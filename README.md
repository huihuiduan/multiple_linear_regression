# multiple_linear_regression

This project is about multiple linear regression. There are three folders: octave, r and python. 

The gradient descent algorithm for multiple linear regression is implemented in octave and a simple data set were applied on the algorithm. Also, the same data set was analyzed in r and python with available packages/modules. The results were compared.
